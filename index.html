           <h4> Argument  </h4>
            <p> Arguments are the values that are passed while calling a function</p>

            <h4> Parameter</h4>
            <p>Parameters are the variables declared during function definition. </p>

            <h4> Callback Function</h4>
            <p>Callback function is such a function which is passed as argument while invoking
                a function. Callback function is called inside the invoking function. </p>

                <h4> Synchronous</h4>
                <p> Synchronous request is such an request that cannot be carried out without the completion of 
                    previous event.  Browser blocks other other request in this case. 
                    Single task is completed at once.
                    Nested function is an example
                  </p>

                  
                <h4> Asynchronous</h4>
                <p> Asynchronous request is such a request that can be carried out along with other 
                    request pending in background.
                    The browser is responsive in this case.
                    Multitasking is possible. 
                    SetTimeOut() function is an example.
                  </p>


                  <h4> Anonymous Function</h4>
                  <p> Anonymous function is a function with no name. It is mostly used in a scenario
                    where function is called and defined at once. It can be used inside addEventListener
                    method.
                    </p>
                  

                    <h4> Hoisting</h4>
                    <p> Hoisting is a JavaScript technique which moves variables and function declarations
                         to the top of their scope before code execution begins
                      </p>
